## Announcement: new license model from version 5
EPPlus has from this new major version changed license from LGPL to [Polyform Noncommercial 1.0.0](https://polyformproject.org/licenses/noncommercial/1.0.0/).

With the new license EPPlus is still free to use in some cases, but will require a commercial license to be used in a commercial business.

This is explained in more detail [here](https://www.epplussoftware.com/Home/LgplToPolyform).

Commercial licenses, which includes support, can be purchased at (https://www.epplussoftware.com/).
